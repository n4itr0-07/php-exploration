# **PHP Exploration ðŸš€**

This repository is my personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with PHP. It contains code snippets, small projects, and exercises as I progress through the fundamentals and various concepts of PHP development.

Feel free to browse, but please note this is primarily a learning diary, not a polished tool or resource.
