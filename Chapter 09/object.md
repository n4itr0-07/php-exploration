# **What is an Object?**

if you look at the world around you, youâ€™ll find many examples of tangible objects: lamps, phones, computers, and cars. Also, you can find intangible objects such as bank accounts and transactions.

All of these objects share the two common key characteristics:

- State
- Behavior

For example, a bank account has the state that consists of:

- Account number
- Balance

A bank account also has the following behaviors:

- Deposit
- Withdraw

PHP objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects because they consist of state and behavior.

An object holds its state in [variables](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-variables/) that are often referred to as properties. An object also exposes its behavior via [functions](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-functions/) which are known as methods.
